# Introduction to the Web

The World Wide Web, commonly referred to as the Web, is an interconnected system of documents and resources accessible over the internet. It is a fundamental part of modern digital communication and has revolutionized the way we access and share information.

## How It Works

At its core, the web operates on a client-server model. A client, typically a web browser, sends requests to a server, which hosts the desired web resources. These resources can include web pages, images, videos, files, and more. The server processes the request and sends back the requested data, which the client then renders for the user.

## Hyperlinks and URLs

One of the defining features of the web is hyperlinks. Hyperlinks, also known as links, allow users to navigate between different web pages and resources. They connect related information and form the foundation of the interconnected nature of the web. Hyperlinks are represented by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), which provide the address of a specific resource on the web.

## HTML and Web Pages

Web pages are created using a markup language called HyperText Markup Language (HTML). HTML provides the structure and content of a web page by using a combination of tags, elements, and attributes. These elements define the layout, headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other content within a web page.

## CSS and Web Design

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is another crucial component of web development. CSS allows developers to define the visual presentation and layout of web pages. By using CSS, web designers can control the colors, fonts, spacing, and other aesthetic aspects of a website, enhancing its overall look and feel.

## JavaScript and Interactivity

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It enables developers to create interactive elements, perform calculations, manipulate data, and respond to user actions. JavaScript plays a significant role in creating engaging web experiences and powering various web applications.

## Web Development and Technologies

Web development involves the creation, maintenance, and improvement of websites and web applications. It encompasses various technologies, frameworks, and tools, such as front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), back-end development (server-side programming languages like Python, PHP, or JavaScript), databases, web servers, and more.

## Conclusion

The web has transformed the way we access information, communicate, and conduct business. Its open nature and widespread adoption have made it an integral part of our daily lives. Understanding the basics of web development and its underlying technologies empowers individuals to create and contribute to the vast digital ecosystem that is the World Wide Web.

Description
Now with over 10 hours of React content.  Just updated on May 15th, 2023.

Massive new React "expansion pack" covers: React basics, JSX, props, state, Vite, MaterialUI, hooks, useEffect, React design patterns, and more.

Hi! Welcome to the brand new version of The Web Developer Bootcamp, Udemy's most popular web development course.  This course was just completely overhauled to prepare students for the 2023 job market, with over 60 hours of brand new content. This is the only course you need to learn web development. There are a lot of options for online developer training, but this course is without a doubt the most comprehensive and effective on the market.  Here's why:

This is the only Udemy course taught by a professional bootcamp instructor with a track record of success.

92% of my in-person bootcamp students go on to get full-time developer jobs. Most of them are complete beginners when I start working with them.

The previous 2 bootcamp programs that I taught cost $14,000 and $21,000.  This course is just as comprehensive but with brand new content for a fraction of the price.

Everything I cover is up-to-date and relevant to 2022's developer job market. This course does not cut any corners. I just spent 8 months redoing this behemoth of a course!

We build 13+ projects, including a gigantic production application called YelpCamp. No other course walks you through the creation of such a substantial application.

The course is constantly updated with new content, projects, and modules.  Think of it as a subscription to a never-ending supply of developer training.

You get to meet my cats and chickens!

When you're learning to program you often have to sacrifice learning the exciting and current technologies in favor of the "beginner friendly" classes.  With this course, you get the best of both worlds.  This is a course designed for the complete beginner, yet it covers some of the most exciting and relevant topics in the industry.

Throughout the brand new version of the course we cover tons of tools and technologies including:

HTML5

CSS3

Flexbox

Responsive Design

JavaScript (all 2022 modern syntax, ES6, ES2018, etc.)

Asynchronous JavaScript - Promises, async/await, etc.

AJAX and single page apps

Bootstrap 4 and 5

ReactJS

SemanticUI

Bulma CSS Framework

DOM Manipulation

Unix(Command Line) Commands

NodeJS

NPM

ExpressJS

Templating

REST

SQL vs. NoSQL databases

MongoDB

Database Associations

Schema Design

Mongoose

Authentication From Scratch

Cookies & Sessions

Authorization

Common Security Issues - SQL Injection, XSS, etc.

Developer Best Practices

Deploying Apps

Cloud Databases

Image Upload and Storage

Maps and Geocoding

This course is also unique in the way that it is structured and presented. Many online courses are just a long series of "watch as I code" videos.  This course is different. I've incorporated everything I learned in my years of teaching to make this course not only more effective but more engaging. The course includes:

Lectures

Code-Alongs

Projects

Exercises

Research Assignments

Slides

Downloads

Colt Steele
Developer and Bootcamp Instructor

Hi! I'm Colt. I'm a developer with a serious love for teaching. I've spent the last few years teaching people to program at 2 different immersive bootcamps where I've helped hundreds of people become web developers and change their lives. My graduates work at companies like Google, Salesforce, and Square.

Most recently, I led Galvanize's SF's 6 month immersive program as Lead Instructor and Curriculum Director. After graduating from my class, 94% of my students went on to receive full-time developer roles. I also worked at Udacity as a Senior Course Developer on the web development team where I got to reach thousands of students daily.

I’ve since focused my time on bringing my classroom teaching experience to an online environment. In 2016 I launched my Web Developer Bootcamp course, which has since gone on to become one of the best selling and top rated courses on Udemy. I was also voted Udemy’s Best New Instructor of 2016.

I've spent years figuring out the "formula" to teaching technical skills in a classroom environment, and I'm really excited to finally share my expertise with you. I can confidently say that my online courses are without a doubt the most comprehensive ones on the market.
